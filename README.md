# about

fusionplus is a continuation of [fusion](https://github.com/deadshxll/fusion) as the work on the original has stopped. it is an attempt to make a good base for further exstension and as a valuable learning resource. as of now, it should not be called a ~~ghost client~~, simply because it does a poor job at hiding itself.

# getting started
- download the source code by clicking on the code button -> download zip
alternatively, you can download the code using [git](https://git-scm.com/):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/l1nxxwrld/fusionplus.git
```
- after opening the solution, set the build configuration to Release | x64 and you can start editing the code
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> neither fusion nor fusionplus comes with an injector, that's because as it was already stated, it's a learning resource not a fully functioning cheat. i would recommend using [processhacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) for injection
